# BTC-PSC-Methylation
Analysis of methylation data and finding methylation patterns in Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) and Bile Tract Cancers (BTC), namely Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and Gallbladder cancer (GBC).

###The pipeline start by importing .idat files (row array-based methylation data) and pre-processes them: reading intensities, transforming to M-values, filtering, normalization, etc.
###More data process is optional: removing cross-reactive probes, removing sex chromosomes, cell composition estimation and data adjustment.
